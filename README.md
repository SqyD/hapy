# Hapy
A minimal Home Assistant client library for Python.
Might work on Python 3+, CircuitPython 5+ and Micropython.

It implements the http rest API provided by Home Assistant as documented here:
https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest

Currently it supports token based authentication, getting and posting entity states and can initiate services.
